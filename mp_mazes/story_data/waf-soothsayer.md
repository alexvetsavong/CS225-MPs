You enter the home, looking for the soothsayer, hoping that he may help you. Suddenly, a cloud of smoke bursts in front of you. You cough and wheeze as the soothsayer appears from out of the cloud. "Sorry, about that, bro." He brushes off the dust from his robes, and he pulls up a chair. "So, you need something?" You explain your situation to him... "Uh huh. Alright, so here's what you do: you gotta go to this one cave cause it's, like, magic or something. Inside the cave, there's this one pool that if you jump in, it should take you back to where you came from."

You don't really question his authority on magic, and you also think that he might have brewed up a special potion beforehand to help him chill out, so you just head to the cave.
