You arrive at the front gate of the castle after wandering around the perimeter for what seems to be hours. After what was actually ten minutes, at most, you walk up to the guard, requesting an audience with the person of highest authority. The guard replies, "eh. Not really feeling it right now."

Stunned by his response, you don't know how to reply. You carefully consider what you should do.

You walk away, circling back around the perimeter of the castle, looking for another way in.

#waf-castle-give-up
You decide to head to the village instead, feeling that they may be more willing to help you.
