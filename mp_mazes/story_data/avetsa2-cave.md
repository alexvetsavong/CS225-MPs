You arrive at the mouth of the cave. After all this time, you don't know what awaits on the inside. You trudge forward, and the tinkling of chimes can be heard in the distance. You finally stumble upon a clear pool, luminescent in the darkness of the cave. You lean forward, and you see images of your home beyond the reflections. Taking a leap of faith, you fall in, hoping to come up on the other side.

*** You got the CANON CAVE ending ***
