As you step out to try and wave down the convoy, they do not notice you in time, and the horses knock you down, trampling over your legs in the process. The convoy immediately stopped, save for one horse that actually backed up over you, running you over twice. One of the knights dismounts and walks towards you. He crouches over you, examining the damage: "Sorry about that, ol' pal. Any way we can make it up to you?"
