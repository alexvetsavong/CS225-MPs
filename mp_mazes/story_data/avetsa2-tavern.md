"The Crimson Lioness" is loud. Really loud. You hear all the tavern patrons making cheers and their loud table talk. Many people are dancing around. Actually, way too many people are dancing around. They're on the tables and counters. You go to the tavernkeep, hoping that he can give you the answers you need. The well-built man is cleaning the mugs with a rag. He turns around to meet you, looking you in the eyes. "Whatcha want, fool?" You motion to him that you are trying to get home, but you don't know where it is exactly. "The heck? Just go live in that dang cave or something." He turns away, going back to his mugs.

Not really feeling like talking to the intimidating man any longer, you decide to go to the cave just to hide from him anyways.
