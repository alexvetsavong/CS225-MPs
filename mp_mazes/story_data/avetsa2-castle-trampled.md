You arrive at the front gate of the castle after what seems to be hours. In the ten actual minutes that passed, the guard hoists you into the clinic located inside the castle. While you lie in bed, you over hear the king walking past the entrance in the hallway. Lucky! You consider your options:

# avetsa2-audience
Deciding that you might as well try, you request an audience from the comfort of your bed. Not that you could get up anyways.

# avetsa2-pass-out
Figuring that there's no point in trying to talk to him with both of your legs looking like empty toothpaste tubes, you decide to pass out from the pain instead of staying awake through it.
