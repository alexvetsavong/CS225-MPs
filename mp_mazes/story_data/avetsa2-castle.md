You arrive at the front gate of the castle after wandering around the perimeter for what seems to be hours. After what was actually ten minutes, at most, you walk up to the guard, requesting an audience with the person of highest authority. The guard replies, "eh. Not really feeling it right now."

Stunned by his response, you don't know how to reply. You carefully consider what you should do.

# avetsa2-castle-sneaky-beaky
You walk away, circling back around the perimeter of the castle, looking for another way in.

# avetsa2-castle-persist
Not taking that for an answer, you ask the guard again to let you in.

# avetsa2-village
You don't bother wasting any more of your time. You head to the village instead.
