You find a loose brick in the eastern wall. You pull it out and what you find amazes you! Only the brick that was loose comes out! You continue trying to pull out more bricks, but it takes you the entirety of the day, and night falls. A patrolling guard notices your suspicious activity and bonks you on the head.
