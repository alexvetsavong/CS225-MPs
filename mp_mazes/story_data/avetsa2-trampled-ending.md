You lie down on your back, without saying a word. The knight, confused by what you just did, asks again: "Are you sure you don't need any help?" You give no reply, and so the knight shrugs and leaves you to whatever you're deciding to do. You continue to lay there on your back without a sound. Legends say that you are still lying on your back to this very day, refusing to budge or accept any medical attention.

*** You got the "TRAMPLED" ending. ***
