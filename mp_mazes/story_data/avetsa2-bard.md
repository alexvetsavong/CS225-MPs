You approach the bard, the sound of her voice becoming ever clearer. Her words resonate through the air, carried by something even lighter than the air. As you stand near her, you realize that her voice and her countenance is identical to that of someone you've seen before. She looked just like Taylor Swift! Taylor continues singing, forming a soft melody: "Oh a cave, a cave, go to the cave. At the cave, you'll find your home." ...Her lyrics need a lot of work.

You head for the cave, since Taylor Swift very blatantly said that that's where you need to go.
