As clumsy as you are, you trip over a rock and fall onto your face. Fortunately, you land in a ditch and the convoy passes you by, thinking that you're just another homeless person. Once they pass, you get up and make sure that the places you saw earlier didn't disappear: to your surprise, the village, the cave and the castle were somehow still there.

#waf-village
You decide to head towards the village, reasoning that the common folk of this strange land would be of the most help.

#waf-cave
For no reason at all, you feel drawn to the cave. You don't understand why, but you can feel that something great is bound to happen if you enter it.

#waf-castle
Thinking that the governing body of this strange land would have the most knowledge, you make your way to the castle's grandiose towers and spires, hoping to find the front gate there as well.
